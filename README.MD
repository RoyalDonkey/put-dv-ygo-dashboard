## Plot ideas

### Serious business

1. Most popular card appearing in decks
	- filter card type (monster, spell, trap...)
	- more filters? (ATK/DEF, normal/effect, ...)
2. Normal monster ATK/DEF boxplots split by rank (stars)
	- filter by attribute
3. Monster/Spell/Trap stacked bar plot according to submission date
	- see exact numbers on mouse hover
4. Card explorer
	- search by name
	- filter by type, ATK/DEF and more
	- display card image and stats (static page, no ggplot)

### For the memes

1. "what does it do" - no. Pots of Greed across all decks
2. "obliterate coefficient" - number of Exodia decks
3. Line chart of prominent cards' popularities over time
	- Dark Magician (Girl)
